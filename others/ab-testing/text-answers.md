**Module 16: Experimental design and A/B testing**

*Checkpoint 2*

For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer. Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test we outlined above.

1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
2. Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
3. Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
4. If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

*Answers*

Framework: Break down prompt into five components: (a) identify treatment and control groups, (b) formalise sample and split sample between groups, (c) build hypothesis, (d) distinguish between key outcome variable and other variables, (e) make recommendation based on statistically significant inferences

| Treatment and control version                          | **Treatment**: people taking the supplement <br />**control**: people taking an indistinguishable placebo pill | **Control:** Employees wear existing uniform for a 2 week period during a non-peak time of the year, <br />**Treatment**: Employees wear different uniform for a  2 week period during a non-peak time of the year, a month after the control period | **Control**: Existing version of homepage,  <br />**Treatment:** modified version of homepage | **Control:** Email without 'please read', <br />**Treatment:** Email with same content sent at the same time to similar receivers without 'please read', |
| Sample                                                 | Groups are randomly sampled from a pool of people with similar preexisting sleep conditions | Two two-week periods are chosen a month apart such that they are non-peak (eg. January after New Year's Eve, before summer, etc.) | 10% of the incoming traffic is randomly routed into the two versions. Care must be taken to randomise segmentation, but over segmentation must be avoided. | Care must be taken to ensure that receivers are homogenous in business value (seniority, rank, size of business, etc). This sample can then be randomised. |
| Hypothesis                                             | Subjects taking the supplement sleep better                  | Hard to say                                                  | Hard to say                                                  | The treatment is likely to perform better                    |
| **Key outcome variable** + other variables of interest | **Hours slept** + energy level through the day, level of freshness in the morning, average number of interruptions during sleep | **Acquisition of new members** + existing member retention, existing members upgrading their plans, satisfaction surveys, etc | **Overall conversion rate** + CTR on initial homepage, member/mailing list signups, add to bags, time spend on site | **Mail open rate, reply rate**                               |
| Recommendation                                         | Will depend on actual experiment results                     | Will depend on actual experiment results                     | Will depend on actual experiment results                     | Will depend on actual experiment results                     |
